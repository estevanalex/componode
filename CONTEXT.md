# Componode

Componode is a single-organization Digital Product Asset Management tool: an
importer-first component catalog enriched by a human-curated product hierarchy
(the Composable Product Model).

## Language

**Digital Product**:
A curated, meaningful thing the organization delivers or operates —
an application, capability, or shared platform. Human-authored, never
imported.
_Avoid_: product asset, service, application (as a catalog term)

**Component**:
A building-block asset discovered by importers — a repository, workload,
database, endpoint, etc.
_Avoid_: asset, resource, service

**Component Instance**:
The operational occurrence of a Component in an environment; carries the
operational status (`RUNNING`/`STOPPED`/`ERROR`/`GONE`), distinct from the
Component's logical lifecycle.
_Avoid_: deployment, environment

**Component Group**:
A flat grouping of Components for organization.
_Avoid_: folder, collection

**COMPOSES**:
A product→product edge meaning "parent is composed of child." A DAG with
unlimited depth; the parent must be `BUSINESS_CAPABILITY` or
`CUSTOMER_FACING`; cycles are rejected at write time.
_Avoid_: parent-of, contains

**CONSUMES_FROM**:
A product→product edge meaning "product consumes a shared `PLATFORM`
product." A different relationship from COMPOSES — never rendered in the
composition tree.
_Avoid_: depends-on-product, uses

**DEPENDS_ON_COMPONENT**:
A product→component edge meaning "the product depends on this component."
_Avoid_: uses, contains-component

**Retire**:
The reversible lifecycle transition `ACTIVE → RETIRED` — the default way to
remove an entity from view. Retired entities keep their data and
relationships and are excluded from default queries unless explicitly
requested; `RETIRED → ACTIVE` restores visibility.
_Avoid_: delete, archive, deactivate

**Delete** (hard):
Permanent removal of a record. For Digital Products, permitted only when the
product has no edges; a wired-in product must be retired instead.
_Avoid_: remove

**Root** (product tree):
A Digital Product with no `COMPOSES` parent. Positional, not type-based —
usually a `BUSINESS_CAPABILITY` or `CUSTOMER_FACING` product, but an
unparented `PLATFORM` is a root too.
_Avoid_: top-level type

**Line of Business / Team / Person**:
Ownership and organizational entities referenced by products and groups.
_Avoid_: department, org unit

**Importer**:
A pull-only integration that discovers Components from an external source.
_Avoid_: connector, sync
